## About

<p class="about-text">Hi! My name is Samuel Buzas and Iâ€™m a web developer from Youngstown, Ohio. I current live in Cincinnati where I am a fourth year studying Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati. I currently work for Learn21 using C# and .Net to create useful web apps for school administration. I am also a game developer on the side, working with Unity to create web based games and VR/AR projects. I'm very involved with the Computer Science community here at UC, serving as an exec member for ACM-W and President of the UC Game Development Group.</p>

In my free time, I study CS topics, read philosophy, and spend time looking for the perfect cup of coffee.
